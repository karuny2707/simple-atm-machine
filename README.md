THIS PROJECT IS A SIMPLE ATM MACHINE, IT DOES SIX FUNCTIONS
	
FOR LOGGING TO THE ATM MACHINE, IT HOLDS PIN VERIFICATION SYSTEM.

ATM MACHINE ENABLES SWITCH CASE ALLOWING MULTIPLE TRANSACTION FEATURE WHEN ONE TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED OTHERWISE THE USER MAY EXIT WHICH IS DONE BY A PROGRAM TO TERMINATE.


FUNCTIONALITY                                                                      

WE USED A SIMPLE SWITCH CASE FUNCTION TO MAKE THE PROGRAM.
WHEN THE SOURCE CODE IS EXECUTED
FIRST IT ASKS FOR A USERNAME AND PIN. SINCE ITS A BEGINNER-FRIENDLY PROGRAM WE HAVE ADDED ONLY ONE USER ACCOUNT.
THEN IT DISPLAYS A MENU TO SELECT FROM AND WHATEVER CHOICE YOU MAKE IT DISPLAYS THE OUTPUT.
THIS IS HOW OUR PROGRAM WORKS.
